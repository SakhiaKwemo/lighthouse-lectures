@here Good Morning Everyone!  If you would like to get a head start in preparation for this afternoon's lecture, you can complete these steps in advance.

```
$ cd /vagrant
$ git clone  git@github.com:lighthouse-labs/assessment-exam-student.git w4-test
$ cd w4-test
$ npm install sqlite3@4.0.9 && npm install --no-bin-links
```

I will post the complete instructions around 12:45 pm EST.


All the Best!
