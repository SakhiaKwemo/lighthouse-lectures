Hello Labbers,

*Welcome to Programming Test #4* (https://web.compass.lighthouselabs.ca/33c9bbdd-8a63-4552-9d0a-e0deffb6f344).

This Programming Test will be very similar in workflow and content to what you've encountered three times before... The questions are mostly focused on asynchronous control flow. 

Just like with our last test, there is a constrained time window, to further simulate real-world challenges. This test is time-boxed to 2 hours. You can continue to work on the challenges beyond the 2 hours, but *your goal is to get to 90/100 in the allocated 2h time*. 

This score of 90/100 is accomplished by completing the first 4 core questions. There is 1 stretch question as well, completing which would take you to 100/100.

Please join this zoom meeting by 1pm EST. Here is the zoom link again: [insert zoom-link-here]

You should be in this meeting, with your video on for the duration of the test. When you're done the test, please let the proctor know via a private message on zoom or slack. And then you could leave the zoom meeting if you wish.

In case you need the help or attention of the proctor, please interact with the proctor as you would in a normal lecture by raising up your hands, or messaging Ian on slack.


*Reminder:* This is an _individual assessment_ so you cannot receive any help from cohort-mates, mentors, or seeking out answers from google. Googling for syntax is fine but not the actual logic of how to solve a problem. 


To start, follow these instructions in your Vagrant VM: 

```
$ cd /vagrant
$ git clone  git@github.com:lighthouse-labs/assessment-exam-student.git w4-test
$ cd w4-test
$ npm install sqlite3@4.0.9 && npm install --no-bin-links
$ npm run start-exam [EXAM_CODE]
[open the folder in VS Code]
$ npm run question 0
[work on question 0, you can run the command above to see the mocha tests as often as you would like]
[repeat for all questions 0-4]
```

You can get your `EXAM_CODE` from the above activity, click on “Start Exam” and you will be provided with a code to start the exam.

Once again, please follow the README instructions CAREFULLY.


Best of luck Labbers!
