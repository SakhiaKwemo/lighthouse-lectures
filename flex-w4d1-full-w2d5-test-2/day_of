@here, the real test is about to begin.

Please join this zoom meeting: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86126960487?pwd=c09EbU9vV2pGMmJrcWRLQUFJNVBOdz09

You should be in this meeting, with your video on for the duration of the test. When you're done with the test, please let the proctor know via a private message on zoom or slack. And then you could leave the zoom meeting if you wish.

In case you need help, please raise your hand, or send a Slack message!

We have allotted 2 hours of dedicated time for you today, but remember that you have until the end of the weekend to achieve a pass which is 100%. 

It works the same way as the mock test. The one major difference is that there is *NO collaboration or help allowed for this test*. This is an _individual assessment_ so you should not be getting help from cohort-mates, mentors, or seeking out answers from google. Googling for syntax is fine but not the actual logic of how to solve a problem. Your goal is to reach 100% by Monday. 

If you haven’t already, please read more about this and other details here:

To start, RECLONE (into a new folder) the test code repo (these are the instructions I shared earlier):

```
$ git clone git@github.com:lighthouse-labs/assessment-exam-student.git w2-test
$ cd w2-test
$ npm install sqlite3@4.0.9 && npm install --no-bin-links
```

Navigate to compass, and find your exam code before running the following
```
$ npm run start-exam [EXAM-CODE]
[open the folder in your code editor]
$ npm run question 0
```

Once again you can get your `EXAM_CODE` from the above activity, click on “Start Exam” and you will be provided with a code to start the exam. 

Please follow the README instructions CAREFULLY. 

Best of luck!
