@here Let's get ready for tomorrow's test!

In order to be prepared for the test tomorrow at 1pm, please prepare by running these instructions in advance of 1pm.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:lighthouse-labs/assessment-exam-student.git w2-test

$ cd w2-test
$ npm install sqlite3@4.0.9 && npm install --no-bin-links
```
(Note that you shouldn't include the `$` when you run these commands!  This is a very common way of indicating that a command should be run in the terminal.)

I will post more instructions and a zoom link around 12:45!
