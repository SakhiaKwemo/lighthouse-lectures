@here *Welcome to Programming Test #3* 

Please join this zoom meeting: << LINK >>

This Programming Test will be very similar in workflow and content to what you've encountered twice before.

The one difference is that it has a more constrained time window, to further simulate real-world challenges. This test is time-boxed to 2 hours. You can continue to work on the challenges beyond the 2 hours, but *your goal is to get to 90/100 in the allocated 2h time*. 

This score of 90/100 is accomplished by completing the first 3 core questions. There are 2 stretch questions as well, completing which would take you to 100/100. Expect the stretch challenges to take you more time and effort.

_You should be in this meeting, with your video on for the duration of the test_. When you're done with the test, please let the proctor know via a private message on zoom or slack. And then you may leave the zoom meeting if you wish.

In case you need help, please raise your hand, or send a Slack message!

*NO collaboration or help allowed for this test*. This is an _individual assessment_ so you should not be getting help from cohort-mates, mentors, or seeking out answers from google. Googling for syntax is fine but not the actual logic of how to solve a problem.

To start, clone the test code repo (these are the instructions I shared yesterday):

```
$ git clone git@github.com:lighthouse-labs/assessment-exam-student.git w3-test
$ cd w3-test
$ npm install sqlite3@4.0.9 && npm install --no-bin-links
```

Navigate to compass, and find your exam code before running the following
```
$ npm run start-exam [EXAM-CODE]
[open the folder in your code editor]
$ npm run question 0
```

Once again you can get your `EXAM_CODE` from here: https://flex-web.compass.lighthouselabs.ca/8d0ec129-448d-4da6-bff5-73da8fd446ab click on “Start Exam” and you will be provided with a code to start the exam. 

Please follow the README instructions.

Best of luck!
