Hey everyone @here,
In order to prepare for this week's test, **please install the test today** so we can spot any technical issues ahead of time.
Make sure that you have accepted our GitHub invite via email or from here: https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/. You will then be able to access the assessment test repo here: https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/assessment-exam-student.
* if you see a 404, it means you did not accept the invite and you don’t have access. Ping @Chetna LHL and include your github username, so that you can be added to the repo.
Change your current directory to be the directory where you want to install the test (Ex.: cd week1 to put it in your week1 folder)
Follow these commands to install the test
```
git clone git@github.com:lighthouse-labs/assessment-exam-student.git w1-test
cd w1-test
npm install sqlite3@4.0.9 && npm install --no-bin-links
```
WATCH FOR THESE POTENTIAL ISSUES:
If you see ‘warnings’ in yellow, you can safely ignore them as they are not errors.
Vulnerabilities issues can also be ignored safely
Make sure your current directory is w1-test before executing npm install
Make sure that you have node version 12.xx or above. You should not be using node version 8.xx.
If you’re using Vagrant, make sure that Vagrant is up
You might get an error related to node-pre-gyp. If you’re getting that error try the following:
```
npm install -g node-pre-gyp
```
If you did not have any errors when installing, there is no further step until you start the test on Friday morning.
PLEASE COMPLETE THESE INSTRUCTIONS TODAY!
If you have problems, you will be able to use the mentor queue to fix them, and tomorrow you will be able to spend the entire test period working!
